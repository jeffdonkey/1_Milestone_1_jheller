Inspiration:
I have two inspirations for this game.  The first inspiration is the financial culture of America. The second is AI generated art.

Controls:
Controls of the game are simple. It is a "click on the button" interface.

Technology Used:
    -Visual Studio Code
    -Google Fonts
    -Dream by WOMBO - AI Art Tool by Wombo Studios, Inc. Used to create background images.
    -RPG Maker MZ by Gotcha Gotcha Games Inc.  Used image pre-sets from it's game engine for most monsters.
    -Windows 10 built-in photo editor by Microsoft.  Used to edit some images.
    -Krita by KDE community. Used to create "bucketofchicken.png".

Future Development, Improvement, and Bug-Squashing list:
    -smooth transitions between fights (async would help)
    -lock-out buttons between fights
    -add some sounds
    -add a map and movement
    -do something with the form name-grab
