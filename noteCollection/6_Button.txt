WHAT TO DO ABOUT BUTTONS

the only buttons needed for the start zone is movement

for all other zones the buttons will need to change based on conditions:
    -start with fight or flee
        -if flee go to randomizer
            -if flee is good return to start zone
            -if flee fail then go to fight
        -if fight go to RPS buttons
        -win or loose movement buttons pop in
