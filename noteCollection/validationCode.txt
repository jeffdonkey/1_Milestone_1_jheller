simple validation for a form. Ensures that a value for Name is entered.
Should polish this to ensure that name is alpha only and limited.

function validateForm() {
  let x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Name must be filled out");
    return false;
  }
}

Example of the HTML for a form and how it invokes validateForm().

<form name="myForm" action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
Name: <input type="text" name="fname">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE HAS A .php ACTION.  NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS/NOT SURE IF IT IS NEEDED.
