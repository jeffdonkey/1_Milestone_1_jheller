Jeffrey Heller's Milestone 1 project

Inspiration for this game is from "old school" dungeon crawlers.  I chose to use a post-apocalyptic setting that reflects my current concerns about the current state of capitalism.  I also enjoy absurd art styles do I use that where I can.

Using simple on-screen buttons for game interaction.
